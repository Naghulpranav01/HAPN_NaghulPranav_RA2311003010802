Problem Statement : 
In underserved communities, financial inclusion is hindered by several challenges, including the lack of traditional credit histories, language barriers, digital illiteracy, high costs of financial services, and complex regulatory requirements. These issues prevent marginalized individuals and small businesses from accessing essential financial products like loans, savings accounts, and insurance, thereby limiting their economic opportunities and financialÂ stability.
